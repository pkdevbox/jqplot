## Overview ##

jqPlot is a pure JavaScript plotting plugin for the jQuery javascript library.  jqPlot was inspired by the Flot JavaScript jQuery Plugin. It relies on the canvas tag for rendering the plot graphics.  IE support is handled through the excanvas.js library.  It is currently in heavy development.  Some highlights of the code:

  * A flexible, and highly extensible architecture.
  * Drawing, data handling and other features are handled through renderers and plugins outside of the core code.
  * Options drive almost all behavior.  Highly customizable.
